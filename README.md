# An Autonomous Spectrum Management Scheme for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks in Disaster Relief Operations using Multi Independent Agent Reinforcement Learning

## Paper
You can find the **article** related to this code [here at IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9046033) or
You can find the **preprint** from the [Arxiv website](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11343.pdf).

## Code
This code is run and tested on Python 3.6 on both linux machine with no issues. There is a config file in this directoy which shows all the configuration parameters such as transmit power, the grid size, number of steps, number of epochs, number of runs, number of UAVs, number of regions, etc. The number of UAVs in this study is variable. You can simply run the main.py file to run the code. It doesn't need any input argument, all you need to configure is available in the config.py. All dependency files are available in the root directory of this repository.
